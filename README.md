# Hidden-Filesafe

I decided to add a project to my portfolio that showed my Python programming skills, a little bit of SQL database skills, and add something fun and functional. This program will allow you to setup a database, connect to the database, and with that database hide files. You can pull them out at a later time. Enjoy!
